# XQuery Interpreter

## About

**XQuery Interpreter** is a custom-built software tool designed to parse and execute XQuery expressions on XML documents. This project was developed as part of a course on database management and data query languages, where the primary goal was to create a functional interpreter capable of handling complex XQuery operations.

Built using Java and ANTLR, the interpreter provides a robust environment for querying XML data. It features an XPath interpreter that is extended to support full XQuery functionality, including the ability to handle nested queries, FLWOR expressions, and various join operations to optimize query performance. Additionally, the project implements advanced query optimization techniques to enhance efficiency, especially in handling large XML datasets.

Key features of the **XQuery Interpreter** include:
- **XPath and XQuery Parsing**: Supports a comprehensive set of XPath and XQuery expressions.
- **Join Optimization**: Implements join operations to optimize query performance and improve execution speed.
- **Custom Grammar with ANTLR**: Utilizes ANTLR to define the grammar for XQuery and to generate the parser and lexer components.
- **Modular and Extensible Design**: The interpreter is designed in a modular way to facilitate future extensions and enhancements.

This project was developed by Darren Trieu and a partner as part of a graduate-level database systems course at UCSD. It serves as a demonstration of our skills in Java programming, compiler construction, and database query optimization. Through this project, we gained valuable experience in developing complex software systems and applying theoretical concepts in a practical setting.
